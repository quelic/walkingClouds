A colorful experiment of three random walkers that paint in primary RGB colours to create a random cloud of colours and shapes. 

Done with p5js.

 * This sketch becomes nicer after some 15 secs of watching, 
 * it is, to me, like watching colorful clouds. Slower speed of the 
 * random walkers allow imagination to go even further.
 * 
 * It is inspired by the 1st lecture by Daniel Shiffman in the course
 * the nature of code, available on kadenze.com during may'16
 * 
 * It is my take on the RandomWalker assignment 1.
